# Monkey Language

This repo is an implementation of the Monkey language from the books [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com).

Whilst the books are focused on implementing the language in Go, I found it interesting to try and implement it in various other languages, including, but probably not limited to, TypeScript and Rust. I'll probably have a go at implementing it in Lua at some point as well.
